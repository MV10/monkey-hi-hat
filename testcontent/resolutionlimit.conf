Description=Debug Test: render resolution limit (same as cloud_tunnel)

VertexSourceTypeName=VertexQuad
FragmentShaderFilename=resolutionlimit.frag

BackgroundFloatRGB=0,0,0

# When specified, rendering draws to a buffer with a maximum
# resolution (largest edge, typically the horizontal axis) if
# the output resolution is higher. Output is upscaled via blit.
# Useful for tuning high-overhead visualizations that don't run
# smoothly at full-screen resolution. Default is 0, disabled.
# See also the global RenderResolutionLimit in the app config.
RenderResolutionLimit=1024
