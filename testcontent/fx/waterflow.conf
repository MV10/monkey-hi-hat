Description=Debug Test: simple FX

# FX always uses VisualizerFragmentQuad and fx.vert from InternalShaders.
# The FX frag shaders must be present in the mhh.conf FXPath pathspec.
# The running visualizer that the FX operates against is the "primary".

# The options are:
# Active   - the primary continues to run, drawing into buffer 0
# Snapshot - the primary is terminated, the last frame is buffered
# Random   - Active or Snapshot is selected when the FX is attached
PrimaryDrawMode=Active

# Like visualizers, a resolution limit can be applied to FX processing.
# The default is 0 which applies any limit from mhh.conf, and the lower
# bound is 256.
RenderResolutionLimit=1024

# When set, the maximum resolution of the primary visualizer will be
# overridden by this value. The default is 0 to disable the override,
# and the lower bound is 256.
PrimaryResolutionLimit=0

# The [process] section is similar to visualizer [multipass] definitions.
# Settings for each pass are space-separated:
#
#  -- Draw-target framebuffer number (1 or greater)
#  -- Input framebuffers: * for none, or comma-delimited numbers/letters
#  -- The name of the FX fragment shader (must be in FXPath)
#
# Buffer 0 is always the primary visualizer. As with multipass, letters
# create double-buffering to refer to the backbuffer with the previous
# frame's contents. If buffer A is referenced, the primary visualizer
# will be automatically double-buffered. If the PrimaryDrawMode is set
# to Snapshot, the contents of buffer 0/A will not change.
