# Monkey Hi Hat application configuration
#
# All conf files used by the application follow the same layout:
#
# blank lines are disregarded
# hashtag lines and trailing comments are disregarded
# [section] is a key for key=value pairs within the section
# confs are loaded as Dictionary<section, Dictionary<key, value>>
# non-key=value entries are stored with an incrementing integer key
#
# This mhh.conf will be read from the application's top-level directory,
# and if it isn't found there, the full pathname to the config file can
# be specified by a "monkey-hi-hat-config" environment variable instead.

[setup]

# If not specified, the default is true (and you will need a separate PC
# or device to control the program over SSH, or with the Monkey Droid
# remote control app). When false, running in windowed mode allows you
# to prepare the app locally (for example, run the playlist command),
# or if you are creating and testing new visualizations. You can hit The
# spacebar on the viz window to switch to full-screen.
StartFullScreen=false

# Default is false. True can be useful to auto-launch at startup/login.
# See also the HideConsoleAtStartup and HideConsoleInStandby options in
# the [windows] section.
StartInStandby=false

# When true, closing the window by pressing ESC or using the "X" button
# on the window titlebar will switch the program to standby mode instead
# of ending the program. The default is false.
CloseToStandby=false

# Default is 960x540 (16:9)
SizeX=960
SizeY=540

# Default is 100x100 on the primary monitor. Coordinates on other
# monitors are in "virtual screen space" relative to the primary.
# The starting window position is optional. Use the --display switch
# to get a list of monitor names, ID numbers, and coordinate rectanges.
# The application doesn't perform any validation of starting coords.
StartX=100
StartY=100

# This sets the global render-target maximum resolution. This defaults
# to 0 which disables any limitations other than the screen resolution
# in full-screen mode. The individual visualizer configuration files
# can specify their own lower RenderResolutionLimit. If a visualizer
# specifies a higher limit, it will be clamped to this global setting.
RenderResolutionLimit=0

# Default is true, but in windowed mode false is often preferable.
HideMousePointer=true

# Default is true. When false, this allows the use of other application
# windows on other monitors. (Focus can change to another window on the
# same monitor, but it still won't overdraw the MHH window.) Note some
# drivers may incur a slight performance penalty with this disabled.
FullscreenMinimizeOnFocusChange=true

# Default is 150. Use 0 to disable. Visualizer shaders are generally
# quite small compared to what modern hardware can handle. Note that
# a cached shader is a reference to a compiled shader program that is
# stored on the GPU but realistically modern hardware can probably
# store thousands before memory starts becoming an issue.
ShaderCacheSize=150

# Default is 50. Use 0 to disable. Like visualizers, FX shaders are
# typically quite small. However, there are normally fewer of them
# and they are reused more often, so a separate cache ensures they
# are not evicted from a shared cache by frequent visualizer changes.
FXCacheSize=50

# Default is 10. Use 0 to disable. Unlike visualizers and FX, it
# usually isn't useful to cache a lot of library shaders. They are
# normally only referenced by a group of related frag/vert shaders
# and once the main shader is compiled and cached, the libraries
# aren't useful. Even 10 is probably overkill, usually just one
# library is referenced (such as Shadertoy's "Common" tab).
LibraryCacheSize=10

# Default is false, which uses the internal crossfade. When true, the
# visualization and library paths are searched for .frag files with
# a crossfade_ prefix (such as crossfade_burning.frag). No conf file
# is used. See comments in crossfade_burning in Volt's Laboratory for
# more details. All crossfade shaders are always cached (there is no
# separate cache size setting).
RandomizeCrossfade=true

# Default is 2. Set to 0 to disable crossfade.
CrossfadeSeconds=2

# Max is 9999, default is 60 FPS. Set to 0 for unlimited (keep in mind
# some shaders, particularly those derived from Shadertoy, may not work
# correctly at higher frame rates).
FrameRateLimit=60

# Prevents frame updates when the monitor is refreshing. Some graphics
# drivers may override this setting. The default is On because Off is
# typically more important for gaming (it can introduce small lags which
# are more obvious when input devices are used). It can also be set to
# Adaptive, which applies only when the framerate drops below the FPS
# target (per the FrameRateLimit setting).
VSync=On

# This is meant to reduce app workload if MHH is left running but the
# music has stopped (for example, you've switched to regular TV). Eventually
# we may want to add options to sleep/hibernate (when available, something
# like the Raspberry Pi has no such capability).
# DetectSilenceSeconds must be a whole number. Default is 0 (disabled).
# actions:
#   Idle       show the default shader
#   Blank      blank the screen (default)
DetectSilenceSeconds=0
DetectSilenceMaxRMS=1.5
DetectSilenceAction=Idle

# Normally there is no reason to specify these or deviate from defaults.

# If provided, the program will listen for commands on the specified

# When unspecified, the default is 0, which is disabled.

# This controls how (or if) video files are inverted. Most graphic formats
# have the origin (pixel 0,0) at the top-left corner, but OpenGL has the
# origin at the bottom-left corner. Testing seems to indicate Internal is
# the fastest option, but you can also specify FFmpeg. If you're only using

# This section is not used by MHH directly. Instead it is read by the
# https://github.com/MV10/monkey-see-monkey-do background service, which
# can launch MHH if commands are received while it is not running, and
# will relay received commands to MHH. The UnsecuredPort option must also
# be specified for the relay service to work.

# This is the port number the relay service listens on. It is 50002 by
# default. If it is not specified (or if the MHH UnsecuredPort is not
# specified) the relay service will log an error and exit.
UnsecuredRelayPort=50002

# Use "4" or "6" to restrict the relay service to IPv4 or IPv6 for
# localhost name resolution. If unspecified, the default is 0 which uses
# both. Due to an issue in .NET's socket-handling, it can be slow to query
# IPv6 when the network isn't actually using IPv6.

# This section controls text overlays (large blocks of information like
# FPS statistics) and popups (short notifications like visualizer names).
# The first group are settings you may wish to customize. The second group

# When a playlist loads a new visualizer and/or FX, a popup is shown briefly
# containing the names and descriptions. Default is true.

# After version 4.3.0 it's likely Linux support will be permanently removed.
