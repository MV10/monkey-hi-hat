# Monkey Hi Hat application configuration
#
# All conf files used by the application follow the same layout:
#
# blank lines are disregarded
# hashtag lines and trailing comments are disregarded
# [section] is a key for key=value pairs within the section
# confs are loaded as Dictionary<section, Dictionary<key, value>>
# non-key=value entries are stored with an incrementing integer key
#
# This mhh.conf will be read from the application's top-level directory,
# and if it isn't found there, the full pathname to the config file can
# be specified by a "monkey-hi-hat-config" environment variable instead.

[setup]

# Default is true
StartFullScreen=true

# Default is false. True can be useful to auto-launch at startup/login.
# See also the HideConsoleAtStartup and HideConsoleInStandby options in
# the [windows] section.
StartInStandby=false

# When true, closing the window by pressing ESC or using the "X" button
# on the window titlebar will switch the program to standby mode instead
# of ending the program. The default is false.
CloseToStandby=false

# Default is 960x540
SizeX=960
SizeY=540

# This sets the global render-target maximum resolution. This defaults
# to 0 which disables any limitations other than the screen resolution
# in full-screen mode. The individual visualizer configuration files
# can specify their own lower RenderResolutionLimit. If a visualizer
# specifies a higher limit, it will be clamped to this global setting.
RenderResolutionLimit=0

# Default is true
HideMousePointer=true

# Default is 150. Use 0 to disable. Visualizer shaders are generally
# quite small compared to what modern hardware can handle. Note that
# a cached shader is a reference to a compiled shader program that is
# stored on the GPU but realistically modern hardware can probably
# store thousands before memory starts becoming an issue.
ShaderCacheSize=150

# Default is 50. Use 0 to disable. Like visualizers, FX shaders are
# typically quite small. However, there are normally fewer of them
# and they are reused more often, so a separate cache ensures they
# are not evicted from a shared cache by frequent visualizer changes.
FXCacheSize=50

# Default is 10. Use 0 to disable. Unlike visualizers and FX, it
# usually isn't useful to cache a lot of library shaders. They are
# normally only referenced by a group of related frag/vert shaders
# and once the main shader is compiled and cached, the libraries
# aren't useful. Even 10 is probably overkill, usually just one
# library is referenced (such as Shadertoy's "Common" tab).
LibraryCacheSize=10

# Default is 2. Set to 0 to disable crossfade.
CrossfadeSeconds=2

# Max is 9999, default is 60 FPS. Set to 0 for unlimited (keep in mind
# some shaders, particularly those derived from Shadertoy, may not work
# correctly at higher frame rates).
FrameRateLimit=60

# Prevents frame updates when the monitor is refreshing. Some graphics
# drivers may override this setting. The default is On because Off is
# typically more important for gaming (it can introduce small lags which
# are more obvious when input devices are used). It can also be set to
# Adaptive, which applies only when the framerate drops below the FPS
# target (per the FrameRateLimit setting).
VSync=On

# This is meant to reduce app workload if MHH is left running but the
# music has stopped (for example, you've switched to regular TV). Eventually
# we may want to add options to sleep/hibernate (when available, something
# like the Raspberry Pi has no such capability).
# DetectSilenceSeconds must be a whole number. Default is 0 (disabled).
# actions:
#   Idle       show the default shader
#   Blank      blank the screen (default)
DetectSilenceSeconds=0
DetectSilenceMaxRMS=1.5
DetectSilenceAction=Idle

# Default is Warning
# Values: None, Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical
LogLevel=Warning
LogToConsole=false

# If provided, the program will listen for commands on the specified
# TCP port. The "dynamic"" port range 49152 through 65536 is suggested.
# Refer to the CommandLineSwitchPipe repo's "tcpargs" utility, or use
# the https://github.com/MV10/monkey-droid Windows/Android remote-control
# When unspecified, the default is 0, which is disabled.

[text]
# This section controls text overlays (large blocks of information like
# FPS statistics) and popups (short notifications like visualizer names).
# The first group are settings you may wish to customize. The second group
# pertains to font rendering and probably can be left at the defaults.

# When a playlist loads a new visualizer and/or FX, a popup is shown briefly
# containing the names and descriptions. Default is true.
ShowPlaylistPopups=true
