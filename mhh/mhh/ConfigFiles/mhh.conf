# Monkey Hi Hat application configuration
#
# All conf files used by the application follow the same layout:
#
# blank lines are disregarded
# hashtag lines and trailing comments are disregarded
# [section] is a key for key=value pairs within the section
# confs are loaded as Dictionary<section, Dictionary<key, value>>
# non-key=value entries are stored with an incrementing integer key
#
# This mhh.conf will be read from the application's top-level directory,
# and if it isn't found there, the full pathname to the config file can
# be specified by a "monkey-hi-hat-config" environment variable instead.

# Default is true
StartFullScreen=true

# Default is false. True can be useful to auto-launch at startup/login.
# See also the HideConsoleAtStartup and HideConsoleInStandby options in
# the [windows] section.
StartInStandby=false

# When true, closing the window by pressing ESC or using the "X" button
# on the window titlebar will switch the program to standby mode instead
# of ending the program. The default is false.
CloseToStandby=false

# Default is 960x540
SizeX=960
SizeY=540

# This sets the global render-target maximum resolution. This defaults
# to 0 which disables any limitations other than the screen resolution
# in full-screen mode. The individual visualizer configuration files
# can specify their own lower RenderResolutionLimit. If a visualizer
# specifies a higher limit, it will be clamped to this global setting.
RenderResolutionLimit=0

# Default is true
HideMousePointer=true

# Default is 150. Must be 1 or more. Visualizer shaders are generally
# quite small compared to what modern hardware can handle. Note that
# a cached shader is a reference to a compiled shader program that is
# stored on the GPU but realistically modern hardware can probably
# store thousands before memory starts becoming an issue.
ShaderCacheSize=150

# Default is 50. Must be 1 or more. Like visualizers, FX shaders are
# typically quite small. However, there are normally fewer of them
# and they are reused more often, so a separate cache ensures they
# are not evicted from a shared cache by frequent visualizer changes.
FXCacheSize=50

# Default is 2. Set to 0 to disable crossfade.
CrossfadeSeconds=2

# Max is 9999, default is 60 FPS. Set to 0 for unlimited (keep in mind
# some shaders, particularly those derived from Shadertoy, may not work
# correctly at higher frame rates).
FrameRateLimit=0

# This is meant to reduce app workload if MHH is left running but the
# music has stopped (for example, you've switched to regular TV). Eventually
# we may want to add options to sleep/hibernate (when available, something
# like the Raspberry Pi has no such capability).
# DetectSilenceSeconds must be a whole number. Default is 0 (disabled).
# actions:
#   Idle       show the default shader
#   Blank      blank the screen (default)
DetectSilenceSeconds=0
DetectSilenceMaxRMS=1.5
DetectSilenceAction=Idle

# Default is Warning
# Values: None, Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical

# If provided, the program will listen for commands on the specified
